<center><h1>Adjustable windows</h1></center>
<p>
The window and step sizes for most sliding-window applications are
constant. Some applications, however, require window and step sizes to
change, depending on the values in streams. Machine learning
applications may need the window size to increase, while the starting
point of the window doesn't move, until prediction error drops below a
threshold. Adjustable windows allow you to write applications that
change window and step sizes.
</p>

<p><b>Step size must be nonnegative</b> If the step size is negative
then the agent is reading elements backwards (earlier) in the stream;
and those elements may have been moved from main memory to archival
storage. Later, you will write code to access this archival storage,
but for the time being, we will write code that only uses data in main
memory. </p>

<p><b>Step size should become positive eventually</b> If the step size
remains zero forever, then the entire stream from that point remains
in main memory forever, and this could cause memory overflow if the
stream grows. </p>

<p> In some applications, the step size stays zero for some time and
then increases, but does not stay zero forever. While the step size
remains zero, the starting point of the window does not move. The
starting point of the window moves forward by step size when the step
size is positive.</p>

<p><b>Window size must be positive</b> The agent operates on a window
(i.e., a list) of size, <code>window_size</code>, and this list must
be nonempty.</p> 

<p>
The adjustable window function, <i>awf</i> is similar to the window
function <i>wf</i>. The function, <code>func</code> that is wrapped in
<code>awf</code> is passed the current window and step sizes as
parameters and <code>func</code> returns the new window and step
sizes. By contrast, the function wrapped in <code>wf</code> is not
passed, nor does it return, window and step sizes because they are
constants. The signatures for <code>awf</code> and <code>wf</code> are
identical.
<pre><code>
awf(inputs, outputs, func, window_size, step_size,
       state=None, call_streams=None, **kwargs)

wf(inputs, outputs, func, window_size, step_size,
       state=None, call_streams=None, **kwargs)
</code></pre>

The signatures for <code>func</code> are different.
<br>
<i>awf</i>:
<code>
func(x, window_size, step_size)
</code>
<br>
<i>wf</i>: 
<code>
func(x)
</code>
<br>
where <code>x</code> is either a list (a window into a single input
stream) or a list of lists (a list of windows into multiple input
streams).
</p>

<p><b>Return values</b>
<br>
<i>awf</i>:
<code>
(y, window_size, step_size)
</code>
<br>
<i>wf</i>: 
<code>
y
</code>
<br>
where <code>y</code> is either a single element of a stream for a
single output stream) or a list (an element for each output stream for
an agent with multiple output streams).
</p>

<h2>Example illustrating keyword arguments</h2>

<p><b>Problem</b>: Write a function that creates an agent with a
single input stream, <code>x</code>, and a single output stream,
<code>y</code>. If the sum of elements in the current window into
stream <code>x</code> exceeds <code>threshold</code> then the window
and step sizes are decreased; otherwise the window and step sizes are
increased.  </p>

<p>The parameters to the wrapped function <code>h</code> are:
<code>window, window_size, step_size, threshold</code> where
<code>threshold</code> is a keyword parameter. The value for
<code>threshold</code> is passed to <code>awf</code> as a keyword
argument: <code>threshold=40</code> </p>

  <b>Solution</b>:</a>
<pre><code>
def h(window, window_size, step_size, threshold):
    if sum(window) > threshold:
        window_size -= 1
        step_size -= 1
    else:
        window_size += 1
        step_size += 1
    return (sum(window), window_size, step_size)

initial_window_size = 5
initial_step_size = 5
awf(x, y, h, initial_window_size, initial_step_size, threshold=40)
</code></pre>
</div>


<h2>Example illustrating state</h2>

<p><b>Problem</b>: Write a function that creates an agent with a two
input streams, <code>u</code> and <code>v</code>, and a single output
stream, <code>y</code>. The agent calculates the standard deviation of
the windows into each of the input streams and the agent's next output
is the maximum of the standard deviations. If this next output is
greater than a percent increase over the last output, i.e. if
<br><br>
<code>
next_output > (1 + percent_increase/100.0) * last_output
</code>
<br><br>
then the window size and step size are increased; otherwise the window
and step sizes are decreased, provided that they do not decrease below
<code>min_window_size</code> ( which is set to 4 in this example).
The initial window and step sizes are 5, and the initial value of the
last output is 0.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/StreamPy/StreamPy/blob/master/StreamPy/tutorial_adjustable_window_multi_in_single_out.py">
<b>Solution</b>:</a>
The state of the computation is the last output. It is entered here as a
positional parameter after inputs <code>[u,v]</code>, outputs
<code>y</code>, func <code>h</code>, window_size <code>initial_window_size</code>,
step_size <code>initial_step_size</code>:
<br><br><code>
awf([u,v], y, h, initial_window_size, initial_step_size,
    last_output,..)
</code>
<br><br>
The remaining parameters, <code>percent_increase</code> and
<code>min_window_size</code> are keyword arguments and are passed to
<code>awf</code> as keyword parameters:
<pre><code>
awf([u,v], y, h, initial_window_size, initial_step_size, last_output,
    percent_increase=5.0, min_window_size=4)
</code></pre><br>

<div class="boxed">

<pre><code>
def h(list_of_windows, window_size, step_size, last_output,
      percent_increase, min_window_size):
    next_output =  max([np.std(window) for window in list_of_windows])
    if next_output > (1 + percent_increase/100.0) * last_output:
        window_size += 1
        step_size += 1
    elif window_size > min_window_size:
        window_size -= 1
        step_size -= 1
    # return output, next window size, next step size, next state
    return (next_output, window_size, step_size, next_output)

initial_window_size = 5
initial_step_size = 5
last_output = 0

awf([u,v], y, h, initial_window_size, initial_step_size, last_output,
    percent_increase=5.0, min_window_size=4)
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2>Example: Split - single input multiple outputs</h2>

<p><b>Problem</b>: Write a function that creates an agent with a single
input stream, <code>w</code> and three output streams <code>x</code>,
<code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> which contain the maximum, the
minimum, and the spread (maximum - minimum) of values into a window of
the input stream. If the spread (<code>dif</code> in the code) is less
<code>threshold</code> then the window size is increased; otherwise
the window size is decreased provided it exceeds
<code>min_window_size</code>.

  href="https://github.com/StreamPy/StreamPy/commit/5d03f9418ceba4bcb9b5d904cbb399a036b6b51b">
  <b>Solution</b>:</a>
<pre><code>
def h(window, window_size, step_size, threshold, min_window_size):
    mx = max(window)
    mn =  min(window)
    dif = mx - mn
    if dif < threshold:
        window_size += 1
        step_size += 1
    elif window_size > min_window_size:
        window_size -= 1
        step_size -= 1

    return ([mx, mn, dif], window_size, step_size)

initial_window_size = 6
initial_step_size = 6

awf(w, [x,y,z], h, initial_window_size, initial_step_size,
    threshold=15, min_window_size=1)
</code></pre>
</div>


<h2>Example illustrating call streams</h2>

<p><b>Problem</b>: Write a function that creates an agent with two
input streams <code>u</code> and <code>v</code> and two output streams
<code>y</code> and <code>z</code> and a call stream
<code>a</code>. The agent takes a step only when it reads a new value
in the call stream.
</p>

<p>The agent computes the mean and the standard
deviation for the window of each of its input streams. An element of
<code>y</code> is the mean over all input streams of the window means:
<br><code>
np.mean([np.mean(window) for window in list_of_windows])
</code><br>
and an element of <code>z</code> is the mean over all input streams of
the window standard deviations:
<br><code>
np.mean([np.std(window) for window in list_of_windows])
</code><br>
If the ratio of the standard deviation
to the mean exceeds a parameter <code>ratio</code> then the window and
step sizes are increased; otherwise they are decreased.  </p>

<p>The point made by this example is that until the call stream
<code>a</code> gets a value, the agent does nothing even though its
input streams, <code>u</code> and <code>v</code>, have unprocessed
values. When the agent reads the first element in <code>a</code> it
processes the unprocessed elements in its input streams. Then more
elements are added to the agent's input streams and the agent remains
idle. When the agent reads the next element in <code>a</code> it
processes these unprocessed elements in its input streams. Thus, the
points at which elements are added to <code>a</code> controls the
points at which the agent processes its unprocessed elements. </p>
